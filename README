## Step to setup
1. `git clone git@github.com:appknox/libdvnc_flinger.git`
2. `cd libdvnc_flinger`
3. `make setup`

This will create a aosp mirror and the required branch checkout. Make sure the disk size is sufficient (recommended 1TB). You can symbol link to aosp with `ln -s <path> aosp` before running `make setup` if the disk is separate mount. This step usually should be done only once and required some time ( approx ~8hrs depending on network and system speed).

## Step to build
1. `make`

The libs are create under the folder `libs`
